## 🔍 Features

- **Object Detection**: Detect tanks, personnel, UAVs, vehicles using Faster R-CNN or YOLO.
- **Image Classification**: Classify terrain, enemy uniforms, vehicles using ResNet.
- **Synthetic Battlefield Simulation**: Generate mock drone feeds and battlefield layouts.
- **Metrics and Visualizations**: Built-in tools to measure mAP, accuracy, and draw heatmaps or bounding boxes.
- **Notebook-based experimentation** for fast iteration and visualization.
